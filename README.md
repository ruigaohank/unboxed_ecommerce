# Analysis and Recommendations for E-Commerce Company
Unboxed is a relatively young (est. 2018) e-commerce company that specializes in offering the latest and greatest products in consumer electronics and accessories. While the company is based in the US, it has a global customer base. 

The company has a large amount of data on its sales, products, marketing efforts, operational efficiency, and loyalty program. To help the company's Head of Operations understand the company's sales trends in the last several years (2019 - 2022), I conducted a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the data. My analysis uncovered insights that can be leveraged to enhance Unboxed's commercial performance. Specifically, I provide insights and recommendations on the following key areas:

* **Sales trends** - focusing on key metrics of sales revenue, number of orders placed, and average order value (AOV).
* **Loyalty program performance** - assessing the effectiveness of the company's loyalty program and recommendations regarding its continuance.
* **Product performance** - analyzing different product lines and their market impact, including refund rates.
* **Operational effectiveness** - evaluating logistics and operational efficiency.
* **Marketing channel performance** - determining the return on investment of various marketing channels.
